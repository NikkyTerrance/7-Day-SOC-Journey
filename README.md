# SOC Analyst – 7 Day Learning Journey

This repository documents my 7-day journey learning the fundamentals of a SOC Analyst Level 1 role using TryHackMe rooms and additional research.

The goal is to demonstrate:
- Understanding of SOC workflows
- Alert triage and investigation basics
- Communication and escalation processes
- Importance of documentation and case management

This repo focuses on **how a SOC analyst thinks and works**, not just tools.
